# PS2-Keyboard-Scan-Codes-Basys-3
Integrate PS2 compatible keyboard to display the make and scan codes on the 7 segment display.
Convert a PS/2 interface that was developed for Digilent NEXUS 4 FPGA board and port it to the Digilent Basys-3 platform.
A typical design flow consists of creating model(s), creating constraint file(s), creating a Vivado project, importing the
created models, assigning created constraint file(s), optional running behavioral simulation, synthesizing the design, implementing
the design, generating the bitstream, and finally verifying the functionality in the hardware by downloading the generated bitstream file. 
Check the system clock timings and IP blocks for both systems to make there won't be any complications.
